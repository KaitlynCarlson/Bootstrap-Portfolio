# Bootstrap-Portfolio

README

In this project, we were asked to re-create our Portfolio from HW #1. This time we used Bootstrap and grid to achieve the same layout. I chose not to include my nav bar and footer in the grid layout- for this assignment, it was not necessary.

The most important aspect of this project was to create a site that is responsive to window size. It needs to respond, and adjust, to the users "viewport." Bootstrap makes this incredibly easy, and media queries really weren't necessary. 

I was able to create both a sticky footer. I was also able to fairly successfully execute the use of sub-rows and sub-columns. There are a few things that are still acting a bit wonky- for instance, my Bootstrap nav bar does not stay precisely centered when re-sizing but that may just be the perfectionist in me, but with more time I am certain I could make this absolutely perfect.
